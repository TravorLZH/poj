POJ Solutions by Travor Liu

This project contains several from-scratch solutions from POJ, which stands for
Peking University Online Judgement, a website where we can see many problems
from many famous coding competitions.

Each source file has a header that tells you the actual problem number:
/*
 * @file	<file name>
 * @brief	POJ <problems no.>
 */

You may access the description of the problem by the following rule:
http://poj.org/problem?id=####
Where #### stands for the 4-digit number of POJ problems
(e.g. POJ 1057 can be accessed by `http://poj.org/problem?id=1057')
