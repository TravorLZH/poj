POJ Solutions by Travor Liu
===========================

This project contains several from-scratch solutions from POJ, which stands for
Peking University Online Judgement, a website where we can see many problems
from many famous coding competitions.

Each source file has a header that tells you the actual problem number:
```c
/*
 * @file	<file name>
 * @brief	POJ <problem no.>
 */
```

You may access the description of the problem by the following rule:
```
http://poj.org/problem?id=<problem no.>
```
e.g. POJ 1057 can be accessed by `http://poj.org/problem?id=1057`
