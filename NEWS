POJ 1035 is about correcting spelling. To implement this, I:

1. Check if the word is already in the dictionary.
2. If not, I enter a loop where words in dictionary are iterated
3. In the loop, check if the word is only slightly (one byte) different from
the dictionary.
4. Or if the word can just add one character to match the correct one
5. Or if the word can just delete one character to match the correct spelling

I use one function to implement 4 and 5 because 4 mean if the correct one can
just delete one character to match the wrong spelling.

I have been struggling with this problem for 1 week.
Here are some experiences.

I am using a binary search tree model to set up the telephone number storage

At first I stored those numbers as strings, but the OnlineJudge says that it
was too slow to be executed

Later I stored these as integers. The printing line is like this:

	printf("%d-%d %d\n",f->val/10000,f->val%10000,f->rep);

But the problem occurs when I meet telephone numbers that start with zeroes

To solve this ultimate problem, I changed the formatting character:

	printf("%03d-%04d %d\n",f->val/10000,f->val%10000,f->rep);

So extra zero will be preceeded if the quotient consists of less than 3 digits

2018-11-10 15:59 Using one array is less complicated

The previous solution of 1028 only works at the site `acm.wust.edu.cn' but
not for POJ, so I adjust the code to one array instead of 2 stacks because
stacks mess up everything

I put the previously solved problem's answer in this directory

I also implemented 1028 "Web Navigation" using stack model

I modify the behavior of append(), before it sorts only the last two
nodes until I met the following circumstance:
1, 3, 4 <- 2
So the new algorithm is to sort all nodes when appending a new one
